I've made my way back to Android. I've been back and forth a few times. My first android phone was the Motorola Droid. I've owned ever version of iPhone as well. In between iPhones I tend to get some new version of an Android phone. My latest is the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. This is the perfect blend of Android as what I call a Phablet (Phone + Tablet).

### A Stylus?

I've been using tablet computing even as far back as Windows XP. I also formally carried a Palm Treo. There is something to be said for having a stylus. I like to take hand written notes occassionally. There is something I still like about drawing. Some of my thoughts just don't fit into words. There is something to be said about being able to draw something on a screen. I do end up exporting my S Notes to Evernote still. Since Evernote does OCR on the handwritten text I can search my hand drawn notes still even. It gives me the best of both worlds like paper but yet digital.

### Battery

The battery on this guy is amazing. I have yet to be able to run the sucker dead in a day. I spent an entire day taking notes from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and only got down to 65%. I even was on 4G all day. 

### Size

Yes this phone is huge. It is a 5.5 inch screen. I don't find it to big. Samsung has done some nice things to make it easy to type on it one handed still by allowing you to put it in one handed mode and the keyboard will shift from one side to the other. Some things are still a reach occassionally but I don't mind.  

### Tablet Time.

I think I've made up my mind. I want to get the Galaxy Note 8.0. It also comes with the stylus which personally I love. I like the smaller form factor tablets personally as since I got my Nexus 7 I never actually pull out my iPad anymore. I may even spend some time and work on more Android apps again.
