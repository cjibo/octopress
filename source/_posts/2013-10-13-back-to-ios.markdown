Well it has been a long time since I have wrote a blog post. I am in the process of migrating my workflow back to iOS. I will be getting a iPhone 5s as soon as it gets shipped and will probably order a new iPad when they get announced. I have been back and forth a few times from iOS to Android and back. My problem with Android seriously is the lack of good apps. Yes all of the apps are there but they just don't feel as published. Below are a few of my recent issues that have pushed me over the edge again.

## Performance

It seems that no matter what device I get Galaxy Nexus, Samsung Note II, they just seem to get slower and slower over time. I was pretty happy with the Note II it allowed me to write on it which I liked but I kept running into problems by accidentally hitting the menu buttons. As of late my phone has been acting really weird and that is even after I rest the phone to start fresh.

## Accessories

Unlike iOS there are not that many great accessories. Great examples are the music integrations. I have a guitar peddle you program with the iPhone, as well as a plug that allows my iPad to be an amp. There just doesn't seem to be that great of integrations with any of the devices. It does appear that Samsung is going down that path with there watch but it is still to early to tell if they will pull it off long term.

## What am I going to Miss?

I probably will miss some of the deep integrations with google, although it appears they have been working hard on their iOS apps. Google Now has been great for me. Yes it does exist in iOS through the Google Search application but it is not a first class citizen. I am glad Android is around and I hope it has success. I will keep my Nexus 7 as I do enjoy that tablet although I do have a few app quirks on it also. I don't believe I will get an iPad Mini but who knows.

## Conclusion 

This will be another interesting journey as I am just getting used to iOS7 on my old iPad 2 before I get my iPhone 5s.
