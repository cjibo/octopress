Over the last year I have been trying to get a grip on my digital life. I am a heavy technology user but I have not always thought that it has been helping me as much as it should. I figure it is about time that I share how I am trying (key word is trying) to get a grip of my digital clutter.

## Physical Tools

I use multiple technologies and even some not so high tech tools today. Below is a list of my current tools.
	* Multiple Moleskine Notebooks
	* Galaxy Note II (Soon to be replaced with iPhone 5s)
	* Nexus 7 (2013 Edition)
	* iPad 2 (with Logitech Slim Keyboard a must)
	* Macbook Pro Retina

I probably should talk about the software tools I use to keep my digital desk organized as well. Some I have been using for quite a long time while others I just picked up as of yesterday.

### Email

I just recently started using Mailbox App on iPad for my personal email. I haven't really decided what to use for my work email yet. I'm currently using OWA app on iPad2. I use the web gmail client and Outlook 2013 on my Windows VM for work email. My system for work email is to flag anything that needs followup if my reply is either going to be lengthy or if the email is to much for me to read at the time. I hate seeing my notification light flash.

### Tasks

For tasks I'm using Trello. It is my personal Kanban. You can layout columns anyway you wish. In my case I have the following columns: To-Do, This Week, Today, Waiting, Doing, and Done. I like to start my week by pulling tasks from To-Do to either "This Week" or "Today". If I deligate a task I move it to "Waiting" and add a comment about what I did. One feature I am starting to use a lot more is forwarding email to Trello. It automatically creates a task and attaches the content of the email. I change the Subject to something that makes better sense before I send though.

### Notes

Tried and true I continue to use Evernote for my digital notes. I even take my notes I write on my Moleskine notebooks and take a picture of them and upload them to Evernote. I have a premium account and by doing this the server side of evernote will scan the images for words. This allows me to search my handwritten notes. This is very important to me as I like to doodle. I don't want to lose that as I may diagram something out and need it later. This also works for Whiteboarding. If I take a picture of a whiteboard anything handwritten will get scanned and made searchable. Thank you Evernote.

The nicest feature of Evernote is that it works on so many platforms. I used to use OneNote extensively and still believe it is a great tool. I just have not been satisfied with there not being a fully cross-platform version. I'm a Mac user and it has to work there as well as Windows. I don't want to have to fire up a Windows Virtual Machine just to run it.
