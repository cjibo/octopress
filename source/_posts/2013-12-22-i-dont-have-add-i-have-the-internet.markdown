Oh that statement I used to always use. I'd be working away and some social or news item would pull me away from my work. I was lucky if I could stay on task for more that ten or fifteen minutes. The thing was it wasn't only when I was on technology. I would find myself drifting off to what I may call "random neuron misfires", but apparently really what I was dealing with was ADD if not ADHD. 

A couple months ago I began my journey of getting medical help which happened to be Ritalin. I've been successful career wise but I had to have a lot of systems to keep things straight. It eventually came down to my wife calling it out more and more. I literally was to the point of always yelling at home. I couldn't think with any noise at all. With four kids there is no such thing as a quiet house. Within a few weeks on my first medicine I found that I could finally focus more. It seems that I had a better demeanor as well.

One downfall with the first medicine is that I began to have side effects I personally could not live with. I've had to deviate to a different medication, but will continue the fight until I can find a balance. 

One additional benefit on the first medication was that I actually started to sleep more regularly. My normal sleep pattern for the last decade has been about four hours of solid sleep max. On Ritalin I ended up sleeping about seven hours on a regular basis. I've just started my second medicine which is Vyvanse. I will ride it out as it does take a little bit for these type of drugs to take affect and stabilize.

If you are like me and hate the thought of being on medication the rest of your life, throw that a side. The benefits out way any fear you have. When I went off Ritalin for a week to verify my issues were with that medication I immediately realized how bad things where. Quite honestly I don't know how I really functioned before.
