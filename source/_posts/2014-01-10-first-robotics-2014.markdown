So another year another <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/" alt="FIRST Robotics" target="_blanK">FIRST Robotics</a> Competition (<a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc" alt="FRC" target="_blank">FRC</a>). Last year was my first year mentoring at FRC High School Team. I mentor the Port Washington High School Team #4804 also known as <a href="http://portpiratech.com" alt="Port Piratech" target="_blank">Port Piratech</a>. So let me explain what FRC is if you do not know. FRC is a varsity "Sport of the Mind&trade;". This is a competion where 25 or more students have to design a team "brand", work as a team, build and program a robot to perform prescribed tasks where they will compete as well as collaborate with other teams in an arena style robotic sport.  

The team is responsible for raising money from sponsors, keeping a budget, designing, building, programming, as well as providing media coverage. Our team is made up of five sub-teams: Programming, Design, Manufacturing, Business, and Media. Each team has their own tasks and goals but have to work together to achieve the goal. This years game is called Aerial Assist. The goal of the game is to score balls (25 inches in diameter). There are four goals. Two high goals worth 10 points. Two lower goals worth 1 point. Each Alliance (three teams) have to work together to get bonus points. There are six robots that will be in the arena at a time. Each will be part of either red or blue alliance. This is a crazy event. The challenge was put out on Saturday January 4th. The team only has six weeks to design, build, and program the robot.

Here is the animation of our game for this year.

The team has to know the rules as there are many. This year's <a href="http://frc-manual.usfirst.org/upload/pdfs/Item31389129105.pdf" alt="Rule Book" target="_blank">Rule Book</a> is 94 pages. Everything from cost of parts to robot construction materials are covered. The students get a great since of what is like to build a product and ship it in a very short amount of time. At the end of six weeks we have bag our robot and we are no longer allowed to modify it. We typically can bring an additional 30 pounds of parts with us for the day of the event. Last year we rebuilt our robot multiple times to try to make it effective. 

Here is an example of what competition looks like during the actual event.

##How can you help?##

FRC needs mentors. Mentors are completely voluntary. Trust me you get as much as you give. Talk to your local high school and see if they have a team. Not an Engineer? So what, you can still contribute. Our team has mentors from all walks of life. We have a social media expert working with our media team. I am the only programming mentor for the team this year, but we also have experts in mechanical engineering as well as electrical engineering. 

Another area where teams usually need help is on the sponsorship side. Our team's registration fee is $5000 just to enter the event. That does not include the cost of parts we may have to buy to make us more competitive. Last year we got a $7500 grant from Rockwell Automation. They also received more than $5000 in donations. Getting your business to sponsor a team would be very beneficial and help produce more engineers for our ever growing demands in the industry.

##Show up and support the kids.##

The <a href="https://my.usfirst.org/myarea/index.lasso?page=event_details&eid=10773&-session=myarea:0A7D788702aa236DDEvKpt165081" ALT="Milwaukee Regional Event" target="_blank">Milwaukee Regional event</a> will take place March 20th through March 24th, 2014. This is a free open to public event. Bring your kids because it is a blast. Check the FIRST site if there is a competition near you.
