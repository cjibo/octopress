So I decided to pick up a Microsoft Surface Pro 3. I have a couple of goals for this. One is to experience Windows 10 on itsks native platform versus running in a virtual machine on my Mac. One of the other reason I wanted to pick one up is to ensure my brain still understands all of the Windows paradigms. As a cross platform developer I feel I have to keep my finger on the pulse of where technology is going. 

With all of this said I'm not ditching my MacBook Pro, iPad, or iPhone. I will be continuing to use multiple platforms. I even have some Linux virtual machines laying around I boot up quite often. 

## The return of the pen...

Way back in the Windows XP days I began to dabble in tablets. This is prior to the iPad. I had quite a few pieces of hardware that were pen-enabled. I always loved working with a pen. I especially always loved working in Microsoft OneNote with a pen. Even since I got my first iPad and styluses came out I began to look for a solution that would give me the feel I wanted. I was never satisfied though. I do still love my iPad but for different uses then what I expect to use the Surface Pro 3 for.

## My creative side...

As some people know I also do a few different creative things such as photography and videography. [Microsoft and Adobe made an announcement in October](http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/6/6921769/photoshop-illustrator-touch-features-adobe-microsoft-partnership) which shows a forward direction with making Photoshop and other Adobe software work better with Windows and touch. I like the idea of both being able to use a pen and touch within my creative software workflows. 

## Not the lap experience I expected...

One of the things I expected to be able to do was set the Surface on my lap and type away. This does not really work with the [Type Cover 3](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/accessories/surface-pro-typecover) though. I almost wish there was another option like a clamshell with keyboard. I think what I'm going to end up doing is pulling out my [Logitech Bluetooth Easy-Switch Keyboard](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/illuminated-keyboard-for-mac-ipad-iphone) and setting the Surface on another surface (no pun intended).

## More to come...

I've literally only had the Surface Pro 3 long enough to install Windows 10, SublimeText3, Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition, and Adobe Cloud. I will probably follow this up with a few additional blog posts about my experiences with it and how it is or is not working for my needs. To be honest I don't believe one device will ever meet all needs. What I really want to get to is an experience where the continuity between devices is seamless. I can say that not having a touch screen on my Mac is beginning to get on my nerves. It feels too natural to reach up to the screen to tap and scroll.
