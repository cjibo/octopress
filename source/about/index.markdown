Well you've found me now what?  I am Curtis Allen Gibeaut Jr.  I am a Software Architect/Engineer.  I am also a father of four and an Insomniac.  I like to make things and sometimes just take pictures and videos of things.

## Photography

I spend some of my time taking photographs although not as much as I would like.  I was formally a Canon shooter but have migrated to the Nikon camp.  Quite honestly I don't really care to much about what gear I shoot with as long as I know how to use it and it feels comfortable.  I have no brand loyalty that way.  My daily shooter is a Nikon D600 through.  I like the D800 as well but feel having two of the same cards is more important to me then the large sensor size.  

## Video

I like to also shoot video.  I don't get as much time doing this as I'd like either but I have made a couple shorties.  The following video is an example one minute clip.  I shot this based on a Philip Bloom Challenge.

I'd like to do more video but haven't had the time recently.  

## Tech

I am currently work for an independent software vendor as a Chief Architect.  I consider myself a technology agnostic engineer.  I like to ensure that whatever I develop has the opportunity to run on as many platforms as possible.  Following good architectural patterns you can leave your solutions open to a wide variety of technologies.  I've developed in Perl, Python, Ruby, .Net, Java, Objective-C, and C/C++.  I may have actually missed a few in there but I like to dabble in many areas.  

I've migrated my life over to running a Mac as my daily machine and I will not be changing away from it for a while.  I do use a multitude of Virtual machines though.  I carry an iPad and an Android Tablet.  I refuse to believe any one platform is better then another.  They all have their place (well maybe not Blackberry anymore).

## Robots?

Well yes I also do play around with robotics from time to time.  I mentor the Port Washington Piratech FIRST Robotics team (4804).  We just recently competed for the first time ever.  My oldest daughter also works with Arduino robots.  I'm still working on a few projects with my Raspberry Pis as well.
